# HOW TO EDIT
Open the whitelist.txt file, press the pencil on the right that says 'Edit this File'

To add a user, add a new username, followed by an equals and a boolean (true/false) indicating whether they're whitelisted (true) or blacklisted (false). Removing the username from this list makes it so they aren't designated as either permission. For example,
to add "notfenv", you would write:

notfenv=true

Be mindful that this is __case sensitive__.

To add commits, add a hashtag symbol before the designation.

# RULES
Do not grief the whitelist file.

Do not grief the README.

Do not insert/remove people for no reason. Preferably state the reason in the commit menu.
