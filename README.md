# HOW TO EDIT
Open the whitelist.txt file, press the pencil on the right that says 'Edit this File'

To add a user, add a new username, followed by a equals and a boolean (true/false) indicating whether they're whitelisted (true) or blacklisted (false). Removing the username from this list makes it so they aren't designated as either permission. For example,
to add "notfenv", you would write:
notfenv=true

Be mindful that this is __case sensitive__.
